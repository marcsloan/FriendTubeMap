# Friend Tube Map

This application creates a custom London tube map made up of the names of your friends as station names. 

It worked by connecting into your Facebook account and pulling in your friend network. It then clustered your friends to estimate those who are most important to you and also those who are associated with each other (i.e. your 'school' friends vs your 'work' friends). 

From this, it would fit your friend groups onto tube lines (i.e. your 'friend' group would become the Picaddilly line) and place the most important friends in the center. It would also attempt to place friends that occupied multiple groups at the relevant interchange points for the tube (although this wasn't always possible). 

The result was a highly personalised tube map made up of people you know. 

## Background

I made this project as part of my application to [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) in 2015. It was inspired by ['The Great Bear'](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/patterson-the-great-bear-p77880), an artwork created by Simon Patterson that depicts a tube map whose station names are famous philosophers, engineers, artists etc. 

## Can I use it now?

The project was built only as a demo. I did think about hosting the service and trying to make something of it, but Facebook were about to close down the data service to a person's friend network, rendering the idea obsolete. It was a lot of fun though and something I'd been thinking about making for a while.
